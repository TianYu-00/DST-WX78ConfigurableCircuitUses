# DST_WX78Configurable_Circuit_Uses

v1.0
Mod to change WX-78 circuit/module uses before breaking value. 
修改WX-78电板使用次数的模组.

Please keep in mind that if you have a used circuit, the value of that circuit uses won't be automatically updated with the values from this mod. 
To make this mod function with the new values, you'll need to craft that circuit again. However, if you have a circuit that is unused(max durability) it'll work fine.
已有损耗的老电板需要重新合成才能更新使用次数, 如果合成了可是没用过/没损耗的话没问题.
